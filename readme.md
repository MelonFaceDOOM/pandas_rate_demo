# Purpose:
These are the files from a python pandas demo. The demo shows how to load data in pandas, do basic manipulations, and ultimately calculate a rate that uses values from both files.

You can download these files by pressing the green "Code" button at the top of this page, and then selecting "Download ZIP"

# Files:

| population_transposed.csv                  | Population data                       |
| pandas_demo_annotated.py                   | Annotated file used in presentation   |
| pandas_demo_clean.py                       | Trimmed down version of the same code |

# Sources for data used in this workshop:
+ [Fire damage data](https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/b5ebfcbd-eb5e-4f7b-850b-ab840408091d)

# Requirements:
## Python
Use google to find instructions on how to install python on your OS (i.e. "how to install python on mac")

Python installation is successful when you can type "python" in a command prompt and the program loads (i.e. it will say "python \<version\> ... >>>")

Type "exit()" to quit python if you opened it.

## Pandas 
Install pandas by writing "pip install pandas" in your command prompt.

pip is the package manager for python. It should have been installed with your python installation.

If pip is not working, google for solutions specific to your os installation (i.e. "mac os pip didn't install with python")

## Troubleshooting
If you are having issues with python or pip, refer to this document, which covers some common issues:
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/

Unfortunately it can sometimes be a pain to get python and pip installed, but once both are working things get easier!
